# Advent of Code 2015

In the spirit of improving my coding abilities, I have decided to practice through some problems from AOC in past years before attempting this year's problems. Below, I'll list some documentation of each day's challenge from AOC 2015. The link to 2015's problems are found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015). 

*Note: the code for each day is in the file `day{i}.py`*.
