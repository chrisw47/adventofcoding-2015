# Advent of Code 2015

In the spirit of improving my coding abilities, I have decided to practice through some problems from AOC in past years before attempting this year's problems. Below, I'll list some documentation of each day's challenge from AOC 2015.

*Note: the code for each day is in the file `day{i}.py`*.

## Day 1

We're given a string containing only opening and closing parentheses, corresponding to Santa going one floor up or down, respectively. For example, `'()))()()()())'` corresponds to Santa going down three floors. The actual instruction is a much larger string, and we essentially need to figure out how many floors this string corresponds to.
